# TM-Mgmt-Best-Practices

This project documents the Best Practices in Translation Memory Management.

## Introduction

The GILT Leaders Forum is a self-organized group of seasoned globalization professionals
representing various companies from the "buyer" side. The group chartered a Translation
Memory Management Task Force to research and produce best practices for translation
memory management, as it relates to translation management systems (TMS/GMS) and
machine translation (MT) engine training.

The purpose of this work has been to gather knowledge from TM experts and transfer it to those
responsible for managing TMs in their own organizations, or on behalf of others.
